  # NOW
  author.posts # => cache read

* Fixed typos in CHANGELOG and README

* Don't instantiate ivar when read from AssociationCollection if options[:cached] == true

  author.posts.delete(post)
  author.posts.delete_all
  author.posts.destroy
  author.posts.destroy_all
  author.posts.clear

  $ rake cached_models SKIP_MOCHA=true

* Bypass cache for will_paginate on association collection

  author.posts.paginate(:all, :page => 1, :per_page => 10)
